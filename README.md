# K_Means-clustering
K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups unlabeled data points into a pre-determined number (\(k\)) of clusters. It works by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster centroid and then recalculating the centroid based on the new assignments until the clusters converge.
